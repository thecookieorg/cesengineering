					<p>UNBC’s biomass gasification heating plant is the first university owned district heating system using biomass heat. This system provides heat to the core campus buildings and is offsetting about 85% of previous fossil fuel consumption. The plant generates up to 15 MMbtu/hr of hot water utilizing local wood residue as a heating source. <br>
