						DOMESTIC TERMINAL LEVEL 3 - 4 ENHANCEMENTS<br>
						<br>
						The Domestic Terminal at Vancouver International Airport was expanded in 2008 with 62,000 square feet of new space for expanded retail and food and beverage options on Level 3 and a public observation area on Level 4. The fit out this space was completed in preparation to the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.<br>
						<br>
						CES Engineering worked in the capacity of Commissioning Authority, retained directly by the Vancouver Airport Authority to provide services on this project. The following building systems were commissioned:
						<ul>
							<li>HVAC, DDC controls, plumbing and fire protection systems</li>
							<li>Primary and secondary power distribution systems included SCADA and Intellimetering subsystems</li>
							<li>Lighting and lighting control systems</li>
							<li>General alarm, fire alarm and public address systems</li>
						</ul>
						Boban Ratkovich and CES Engineering staff provided leadership to the commissioning process. I was very pleased with the performance by CES Engineering on this project and would recommend CES Engineering for similar services.<br>
