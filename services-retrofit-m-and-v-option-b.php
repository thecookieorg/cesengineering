					<p>
						Our typical measurement and verification services for energy retrofit project are in line with option B (retrofit isolation) from 
						the 2002 International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP) Volume I, 
						Concept and Options for determining energy and water savings. These services are intended for retrofits with performance factors 
						(e.g., end-use capacity, demand, power) and operational factors (lighting operational hours, cooling ton-hours) that can be measured
						at the component or system level and where long-term performance needs to be verified. We utilize continuous metering of all energy 
						quantities, or all parameters needed to calculate energy, during the performance period. This approach provides the greatest accuracy 
						in the calculation of savings.<br>
						<br>
						Our services include physical assessment of equipment change-outs to ensure that the installation is to specification. 
						The potential to generate savings is verified through observations, inspections, and continuous metering of energy or proven 
						proxies of energy use, such as variable frequency drive speed for motor power. Baseline models are typically developed by correlating
						metered energy use with key independent variables.<br>
						<br>
						Depending on the ECM, spot or short-term metering may be sufficient to characterize the baseline condition, and the continuous 
						metering of one or more variables may occur after retrofit installation. We utilize spot or short-term measurements in the 
						performance period to determine energy savings when variations in performance are not expected, and may support some normalized 
						savings approaches though adjustments to the baseline and/or the performance period model(s). When variations are expected, we
						measure factors continuously during the contract period. Continuous monitoring of information is used to improve or optimize the 
						operation of the equipment over time, thereby improving the performance of the retrofit. Performing continuous measurements or 
						periodic measurements over the term of the contract will account for operating variations and will result in closer approximations
						of actual energy savings. Continuous measurements provide long-term persistence data on the energy use of the equipment or system.<br>
						<br>
						Data collected for energy savings calculations are used to improve or optimize the operation of the equipment on a real-time basis, 
						thereby improving the benefit of the retrofit. For constant-load retrofits, however, there are no inherent benefits of continuous over
						short-term measurements.
