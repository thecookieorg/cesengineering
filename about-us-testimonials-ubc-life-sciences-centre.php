						UBC Technical Services congratulates CES Engineering Ltd on the successful completion of the UBC Life Science Centre building project.<br>
						<br>
						The UBC Life Sciences centre is the largest building (550,000 square feet area) on the UBC Vancouver campus. This medical teaching and research facility includes a variety of laboratories, lecture theatres, classrooms, seminar and reading rooms and administration offices. Large scale Vivarium and Containment Level 3 Laboratories are located on the basement floors.<br>
						<br>
						The multi-phase design, construction and commissioning project stretched over nine years. CES Engineering, acting in a capacity of the project Commissioning Authority on behalf of the UBC Property Trust, was engaged from the early design stage. <br>
						<br>
						CES Engineering completed the following project services: 
						<ol>
							<li>Mechanical systems commissioning for the base building systems and upper floors laboratories</li>
							<li>Mechanical systems commissioning and air & water balancing for the large Vivarium area</li>
							<li>Total building systems commissioning for CL3 laboratory (architectural, electrical and mechanical systems)</li>
							<li>Third party commissioning for proprietary effluent decontamination system</li>
							<li>Third party commissioning for proprietary large room decontamination system (decon chamber)</li>
							<li>Containment level 3 laboratories certification services</li>
						</ol>
						CES engineering personnel provided leadership, direction and problem solving expertise in many critical areas throughout this project.<br>
						<br>
						UBC technical services would like to use this opportunity to commend CES Engineering for continuous dedication, service attitude and professionalism performed during this extremely difficult project.<br>
