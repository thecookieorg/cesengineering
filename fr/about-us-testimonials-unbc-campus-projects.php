						University of Northern British Columbia has repeatedly been named the best small university west of Atlantic Canada. In 2010, UNBC won the award for Top Campus Sustainability Program in North America. University campus sits on a 5.5 square kilometer property and includes building areas in about 97,500 square meters.<br>
						<br>
						CES Engineering worked in a capacity of Commissioning Authority hired by the UNBC Facility Services on the following projects: 
						<ul>
							<li>Teaching Laboratory (mechanical systems commissioning, testing and balancing, mechanical systems O&M manuals preparation)</li>
							<li>Dr Donald Rix Centre – Vivarium Laboratory (mechanical systems commissioning, mechanical systems O&M manuals preparation)</li>
							<li>Teaching and Learning Centre (mechanical systems commissioning, mechanical systems O&M manuals preparation)</li>
							<li>Power Plant Upgrade Project (mechanical systems commissioning, mechanical systems O&M manuals preparation)</li>
							<li>Bioplant Building System (LEED Commissioning Authority)</li>
							<li>Bioplant Gasification Process (Commissioning Services)</li>
							<li>Bioplant, Hot Water Plant and Central Heating Distribution Plant operation optimization</li>
						</ul>
						I became professionally acquainted with Boban Ratkovich and CES Engineering in 2001 and we have stayed in professional contact continuously through engagements relating to their commissioning work on the above listed projects. I have been impressed by Boban's leadership, direction and problem solving expertise in all aspects of these complicated projects.<br>
						<br>
						Boban's professionalism and breadth of knowledge clearly demonstrate that he is a key figure in the commissioning industry in the province of B.C. <br>
