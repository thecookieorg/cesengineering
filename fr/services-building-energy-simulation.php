						CES has created numerous energy models to validate the design energy efficiency of buildings for LEED certification.  
						We are proficient with the modeling programs IES, eQuest, EE4, EnergyPlus, and HAP.  
						For LEED projects, our modeling typically follows at minimum a 3 stage process – schematic design evaluation,
						construction document update and confirmation, and as-constructed finalization.  Starting the modeling process 
						early guarantees that a project’s energy efficiency and LEED goals will be met or exceeded at no additional cost.<br>
						<br>
						Energy modeling is a powerful tool, and preferably the modeling process would begin at the conceptual design phase to
						minimize building loads by adjusting building orientation, floor plans, glazing, shading, and materials.  
						Our experience with energy modeling means that we understand all the relevant factors influencing building loads and 
						energy use and the interactive effects of reducing energy use in one system causing increases in another system.  
						CES can advise a design team on energy efficiency measures and can review the design to identify practical and 
						cost-effective methods of further reducing energy use.<br>
						<br>
						We are flexible to tailor our modeling services to your project budget and requirements, from basic modeling for 
						demonstrating code compliance to thermal comfort analysis for radiant systems, parametric analysis for design efficiency 
						optimization, and life cycle costing to evaluate the cost effectiveness of energy efficiency measures.
