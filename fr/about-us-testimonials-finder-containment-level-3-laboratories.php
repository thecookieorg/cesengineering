						I have had the pleasure of knowing Boban since 2005 while working on the feasibility phase of the above project. To date we have stayed in touch while working on the same project. Boban always came across as very knowledgeable in the fields of design, construction, commissioning and operation of Containment Level 3 laboratories. His leadership skills and expertise in dealing with complicated problems has always stood out. <br>
						<br>
						I would strongly recommend Boban Ratkovich and CES Engineering Ltd for similar work on other CL 3 laboratory projects and would like to use this opportunity to thank Boban and CES Engineering staff for their continuous dedication, service attitude and professional experience throughout the successful establishment and certification of FINDER at UBC.<br>
