						<h4>Synergy</h4>
						<p>
							Our core services (total building commissioning, energy systems measurements and verifications, energy analysis and modeling) interact synergistically facilitating the holistic approach to the building systems commissioning. 
						</p>
						<h4>Total Building Commissioning</h4>
						<p>	
							We are expanding commissioning services to other building systems apart from HVAC systems. These include building envelope, electrical distribution and lighting systems, communication and technology systems. Utilizing Total Building Commissioning we recognize the integrated nature of all building systems’ performances, which impact sustainability, workforce productivity, occupant comfort and safety and security.
						</p>
						<h4>Combination of Design and “Hands on” Commissioning Experience</h4>
						<p>
							We provide expert engineering consulting and hands-on commissioning services in all phases of commissioning process. We possess all testing instruments required for hands on testing and verifications of HVAC and other building systems. Existing and/or new facility systems performance surveys are completed with in-house testing and measuring tools and manpower. 
						</p>
						<h4>Retrofit Design Services</h4>
						<p>	
							Our personnel experience includes over hundred of retrofit projects, ranging from simple tenant improvements to complex multi-million dollar projects. We provide full range of mechanical and electrical engineering services (reports, feasibility studies, design), building permits and tendering services, preparation of construction documents, project management services, review of the construction progress and quality assurance, advise on payments, project costs control and budgets estimates, advise on various aspects of construction contracts, expertise in managing and administrating incentive applications.
						</p>
						<h4>Energy Studies and Energy Modeling</h4>
						<p>	
							C.E.S. Engineering possesses comprehensive knowledge and experience in a variety of energy modeling computer programs and in creating calibrated energy simulations. We have created custom-made calculation tools to improve and streamline the analysis process, which utilizes inverse modeling techniques. The company portfolio includes energy study and modeling services for health care and research laboratory facilities, and commercial and residential buildings.
						</p>
						<h4>Performance Measurement and Verification Specialization</h4>
						<p>
							C.E.S. Engineering is an industry leader in building systems sub-metering, data collection, reporting and analysis. The company provides comprehensive measurement and verification services in line with LEED M&V credit requirements, following key M&V guidelines and protocols.
