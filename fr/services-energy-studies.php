						Even LEED certified buildings may not be living up to their true efficiency potential.
						A thorough investigation of a building’s systems, equipment and control sequences can yield dozens of energy savings opportunities, 
						from the simple to the complex.  
						Solutions to improve energy efficiency can also be coordinated with efforts to improve operational efficiency and resolve 
						equipment and control issues.<br/>
						CES utilizes the latest tools and techniques, and a cost-effective approach to determining the most appropriate energy 
						conservation measures for the buildings we investigate which includes:
						<ul>
							<li>Reviewing drawings, specifications, equipment schedules, control sequences, and the building control system</li>
							<li>Creating trend logs to better analyze current operation</li>
							<li>Interviewing facility management about operational issues, and changes to control sequences</li>
							<li>Investigating the site and taking measurements of light levels and equipment power use</li>
							<li>Calculating energy savings and determining the measure paybacks</li>
						</ul>
						Depending on the project, CES will create calibrated energy models of buildings or systems to determine the annual minimum 
						energy control sequences.
