					<p>The decontamination chamber is “Steris” proprietary pre-engineered solution for aseptic processing in research and production applications. The decontamination chamber provides for gaseous decontamination of the large bio-containment equipment. <br>
					This system contains welded stainless steel chamber and open loop bio-decontamination system utilizing Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide (VHP) technology.<br>
					<br>
					The decontamination chamber is applied at the UBC Life Science Centre Containment Level 3 Laboratory.<br>
					<br>
					CES Engineering, working as the third party bio-containment consultant for UBC Facility Group, played a major role in implementation of this system. Our services for this project included:
					<ul>
						<li>Selection of appropriate decontamination technology based on project specific conditions and parameters. The work included analysis of the current gaseous decontamination market and industry as well as a number of proprietary technology solutions</li>
						<li>Assistance in preparation of the selected technology RFP documents</li>
						<li>Tender evaluations and vendor selection</li>
						<li>Shop drawings review and process customization to specific project requirements</li>
						<li>Factory acceptance tests witness, acceptance and deficiency reports (Syracuse, New York)</li>
						<li>Site acceptance tests acceptance and validations</li>
						<li>Operator training and project record documentation assistance</li>
