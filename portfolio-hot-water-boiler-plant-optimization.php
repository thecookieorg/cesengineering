					<p>Five Vancouver residential towers in BC’s lower mainland underwent boiler plant retrofits to replace the existing the boiler plants with high efficiency condensing boilers and variable speed hot water pumps.<br>
					<br>
					CES provided measurement and verification services for the projects, following IPMVP option B: retrofit isolation.  Through monitoring and tracking overall plant efficiency with a centralized ecoOPERA™ EMIS, we were able to identify deficiencies in the plant control sequences that were causing sub-optimal performance, including low boiler thermal efficiencies.  Recommendations were made to optimize the plant operation.</p>
